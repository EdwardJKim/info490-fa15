# INFO 490: Foundations of Data Science #

INFO 490: Foundations of Data Science uses an project-based approach to
indoctrinate students into the tools and technologies necessary for
working with large data.

## Course Goals ##

Upon completion of this course, students will be expected to understand
the basic concepts of data science. Students will learn how to work at a
Unix prompt, how to use the Python programming language to process,
visualize, and persist large data sets, and how to use database
technologies including SQL.

## Prerequisites ##

There are no pre-requisites for this course, except for an interest in
learning the basic skills necessary for being a data scientist and
access to a computer to participate in the course lectures, and to
complete the required course assignments. NOTE: At this point in time,
we plan to use a JupyterHub server running on a private cloud computing
system maintained by NCSA. Alternatively, students can elect to use
their own computer system to perform many of the requirements for this
course (assignment submission and peer assessment are still done via the
private cloud, however). If students wish to also run a local copy of
this JupyterHub server, they will need to have root access to a UNIX
system, for example a Linux or mac based computer. Since installing all
of the software we use in this class can be difficult, we strongly
encourage students to use a virtual docker image in which we have
pre-installed all course software. Thus, before starting the online
course, students will be expected to have successfully installed the
course-specific virtual machine (this requires installing the freely
available Docker application). Instructions are provided on the course
Github site.

## Texts ##

There are no required textbooks for this course. Instead, we will
utilize internet accessible websites and documentation as supplemental
material to the lesson content.

## Weekly Format ##

Each week will provide learning objectives and an outline of the
activities for that week with a list of all deadlines and corresponding
point values for assignments.

### Videos ###

Each week there will be at least one video that will offer a broader
context for the new week, explain key concepts, and demonstrate
important tasks. To view them, you will need to login to the Illinois
Mediaspace (links are embedded in the relevant weekly overview (and
occasionally a lesson). By viewing all videos for a week, you will be
given twenty points. In case you are wondering, Illinois Mediaspace tracks
the viewing of course videos.

### Readings ###

Readings will consist of articles and excerpts from books and Web sites,
and in some cases IPython Notebooks that can be viewed statically on the
Github website, or (via the preferred approach) by interacting with them
via the course JupyterHUb server. You will be required to read and be
familiar with the content of these documents. Readings are
contextualized as part of the weekly lesson content and are located in
the "Readings" section of each lesson.

### Lessons ###

Lessons will expand upon, or clarify key concepts in the reading
assignments or supplement or add to the reading. All lessons for a given
week must be completed by 6:00 PM Central on Thursday of that week.

### Lesson Assessments ###

Each week will contain three lesson modules (except for the last week,
which will contain only one). A lesson module will will include a Moodle
quiz designed to be taken after completing the readings and carefully
reviewing the lesson material. Lesson quizzes will allow two attempts,
to ensure students have mastered the relevant material before advancing
to the next lesson module. The lessons assessments must all be completed
by 6:00 PM Central on Thursday of that week.

### Assignments ###

Every week but the first and last will contain an assignment that will
involve one or more computational tasks related to the focus for that
given week. The assignment will be automatically extracted from your
JupyterHub server at the indicated deadline. You will have a 24-hour
late period, at which a second extraction process will be performed. No
assignment will be accepted past this deadline. The full credit
assignment deadline is 6:00 PM Central on Saturday of that week. 

### Peer Review ###

Weekly assignments will be reviewed by course peers, as well as the
instructor. 40% of the grade for each weekly assignment submission will
derive from peer review, 60% from instructor review. You will receive 50
pts each week for simply viewing and grading your peers' assignments.
Note that you can (and should) still grade your peers even if you miss
an assignment submission. Peer review of an assignment must be completed
by 6:00 PM Central on Tuesday of the following week (i.e., you submit
your assignment on a Saturday and then must peer assess other students
assignments by the following Tuesday). You will be assigned assignments
to grade approximately one hour after the late assignment deadline, thus
around 7:00 pm Sunday evening.

### Weekly Quizzes ###

In addition to the lesson quizzes, each week will conclude with a weekly
quiz. The weekly quiz is designed to test your overall mastery of the
content for each given week. Unlike the lesson quizzes, weekly quizzes
will be timed and will not allow multiple attempts. The quiz must be
completed by 6:00 PM Central on Friday of that week.

### Exams ###

This course is project-based in its use of assignments that build
progressively on content mastery, application, and peer review; there
are no exams in this course.

## Grading ##
### Grading Distribution ###
|Assignment | Points| Occurrences| Total Points |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
|Pre-Class Activity: Introduce Yourself| 60|1|60|
|Orientation Quiz|70|1|70|
|Lesson Assessments|60|14 (Week 15 is only 20 points)|860|
|Weekly Quizzes|70|14 (No quiz in Week 15)|980|
|Weekly Videos|20|16 (including the Orientation Week video)|320|
|Assignments (Weeks 2-14)|150|13 |1950|
|***Total***|||***4240***|

Note, after the lowest three weekly scores are dropped from weeks 2-14, 
the maximum total score for the class is **3340**.

### Missed Weeks ###

While you are still strongly encouraged to complete all activities in
the course, we will drop your three lowest weekly grades from the second
to the fourteenth weeks. Since later topics build on earlier topics,
however, it is in your best interest to still complete all readings,
even if after the relevant deadline.

### Grading Scale ###

Final grades will be graded on a curve, if necessary. The letter grade
cutoffs will be set at the traditional 90%, 80%, and 70% limits, and
plus/minus will be added if you are within two points of the traditional
cutoffs (so 100–98 is an A+ and 90–92 is an A-).

|Percentage|Letter Grade|
|--------|---------|
|98-100|A+|
|92-98|A|
|90-92|A-|
|88-90|B+|
|82-88|B|
|80-82|B-|
|78-80|C+|
|72-78|C|
|70-72|C-|
|68-70|D+|
|62-68|D|
